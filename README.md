In class and take home assignment. Recreate this layout in part 1 and style it up in part 2.

## Part 1
Try to recreate this page as closely as possible in functionality, structure, and design. Here we want to practice using valid HTML and CSS and bootstrap classes. Minimal CSS should be required to recreate the example. Make sure to account for mobile and desktop views.

## Part 2
Take what you've created in part one and design and style to your personality. Here you can play around with colors, swap images, and lay out a new layout! Below is an example of what you can do and help you get started, but does not need to be copied.
